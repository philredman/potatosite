                <p>BOB ROSS IPSUM: Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>
                <p>BOB ROSS IPSUM 2: This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>
